# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Description

The **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization project designed to explore the fascinating microbial ecosystem that thrives in human navels. The dataset catalogs microbes, revealing that while a few microbial species are common in over 70% of individuals, many are rare.

This project employs D3.js and other visualization libraries to create an interactive dashboard that features:

- A horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for each individual.
- A bubble chart illustrating the abundance and diversity of OTUs for a given sample.
- A metadata panel displaying demographic information for the selected sample.
- Interactive updates across all visualizations based on user input from a dropdown menu.
